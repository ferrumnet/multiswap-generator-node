# app.ts

The `src/app.ts` file from the `ferrumnet/multiswap-generator-node` repository contains the main application setup for an Express.js server. Below, I'll document each function and major component detailed in this file:

### File: `src/app.ts`

-   Imports: Standard Express.js and TypeScript imports. Also imports a custom middleware named `responseAppender` from the `./middlewares/response` directory.
-   app: Initializes a new Express application.

-   express.json(): Middleware that parses incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.

-   express.urlencoded({ extended: true }): Middleware to parse URL-encoded bodies. The `extended: true` specifies that the URL-encoded data will use the qs library allowing for rich objects and arrays to be encoded into the URL-encoded format.

-   responseAppender: An asynchronous custom middleware function that presumably appends or modifies the response object in some way before passing control to the next middleware function. It invokes the imported `response` middleware internally.

-   Error Handling Middleware: This middleware catches any requests that haven't been handled by earlier middleware or routes and sends a 404 Not Found error.

-   Export: The configured Express application is exported for use in other parts of the application, typically where the server is started.

This breakdown provides an overview of how the Express server is configured and includes key middleware that parses incoming requests and handles errors.

# index.ts

The `index.ts` file in the GitHub repository `ferrumnet/multiswap-generator-node` serves as the main entry point for the application. Below is a detailed documentation of each function and component in the file:

### 1\. Imports

-   dotenv: This module loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`, providing access to configuration settings.
-   app: This import fetches the Express application configured in the `app.ts` file.
-   awsSecretsManager: Imports a utility function for managing AWS secrets, likely used to securely fetch configuration data.
-   transactionsJob, rpcNodeJob: These are scheduled jobs imported from the `crons/index` file, responsible for executing tasks at specified intervals.

### 2\. Configuration and Environment Setup

-   This line executes the `config` function from the `dotenv` package, which reads the `.env` file and loads the variables into `process.env`.

### 3\. Asynchronous Self-Invoking Function

-   awsSecretsManager(): Before starting the server, it ensures that AWS secrets are loaded, indicating that the application likely relies on AWS for some functionalities.
-   rpcNodeJob.rpcNodeJob() and transactionsJob.transactionsJob(): Starts the defined cron jobs for handling RPC node tasks and transaction-related tasks, respectively.
-   The function is self-invoking, meaning it runs immediately upon file execution. Errors during the execution are caught and logged to the console.

### 4\. Server Initialization

-   server: Creates an HTTP server that listens on the port defined in the environment variables. It logs to the console once the server is successfully listening, providing feedback about the server's status.

This file primarily sets up the application environment, imports necessary modules, starts cron jobs, and initializes the HTTP server.
